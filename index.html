    <h1>Classical Guitar</h1>
    <p>     The <strong>classical guitar</strong> (also known as the nylon-string guitar or Spanish guitar) 
        is a member of the guitar family used in classical music and other styles. 
        An acoustic wooden string instrument with strings made of gut or nylon, 
        it is a precursor of the modern steel-string acoustic and electric guitars,
        both of which use metal strings. <strong>Classical Guitars </strong> derive from the Spanish vihuela 
        and gittern of the fifteenth and sixteenth century. Those instruments evolved into 
        the seventeenth and eighteenth-century baroque guitarâ€”and by the mid-nineteenth century, 
        early forms of the modern <strong>classical guitar</strong>.
